  <p>Newton went to a mall. There are N items in a shop. For each i=1, 2, …, N, the price of the i- th item is Ai Rs. Newton has K coupons. Each coupon can be used on one item. You can use any number of coupons, possibly zero, on the same item. Using k coupons on an item with a price of a Rs allows him to buy it for max{a−kX, 0} Rs.
Print the minimum amount of money Newton needs to buy all the items.

  <p>The students of Newton School threw a grand party to celebrate their hard work and achievements. They danced and sang the night away, enjoying delicious food and creating memories that would last a lifetime.
There are N guests in the party and N-1 relationships are given. The guests are numbered 1, 2,. , N. The i- th relationship depicts that guest ai and guest bi are friends.
Determine whether a guest exists or not who is a friend of all other guests.
Here, we only consider the direct friendship.

  <p>You are given two strings S and T. Determine whether it is possible to make S and T equal by doing the following operation at most once:

Choose two adjacent characters in S and swap them.

Note that it is allowed to choose not to do the operation. Input The input line contains two strings in separate lines.

Constraints Each of S and T is a string of length between 2 and 100 (inclusive) consisting of lowercase English letters. S and T have the same length.
