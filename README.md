  <p>Newton went to a mall. There are N items in a shop. For each i=1, 2, …, N, the price of the i- th item is Ai Rs. Newton has K coupons. Each coupon can be used on one item. You can use any number of coupons, possibly zero, on the same item. Using k coupons on an item with a price of a Rs allows him to buy it for max{a−kX, 0} Rs.
Print the minimum amount of money Newton needs to buy all the items.

  <p>You are given strings S and T consisting of lowercase English letters. Determine whether T is a (contiguous) substring of S.
A string Y is said to be a (contiguous) substring of X if and only if Y can be obtained by performing the operation below on X zero or more times.


Do one of the following.
i) Delete the first character in X.
ii) Delete the last character in X.
For instance, the tag is a (contiguous) substring of voltage, while ace is not a (contiguous) substring of atcoder.
Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S
T


Constraints
S and T consist of lowercase English letters.
